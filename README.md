# Client Management System

This is a web application for managing clients. It allows you to add, edit and delete clients, as well as filter and sort the client list. The application uses a RESTful API to communicate with the server, and all client data is stored in a JSON file on the server.

## Installation

To run the application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have installed them, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository using the command line.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Open the web application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

When you first open the application, you will see a list of all the clients in the system. You can add a new client by clicking the "Add Client" button, edit a client by clicking the "Edit" button next to their name, or delete a client by clicking the "Delete" button next to their name.

To filter the client list, type a search query in the search bar at the top of the page. The list will be updated in real-time to show only the clients that match the search query.

To sort the client list, click on one of the column headers in the table. The list will be sorted in ascending order based on that column. Click the same column header again to sort the list in descending order.
